# Requirements optimized for NVIDIA Jetson with ultralytics:jetpack5 Docker container
# Note: Most dependencies (torch, ultralytics, numpy, etc.) are already included in the base image
# Only install additional packages needed for our application

# NumPy (must be < 2.0 for OpenCV compatibility)
# Required for native installation (not needed in Docker as it's in base image)
numpy<2.0

# OpenCV (ensure compatibility with ultralytics)
opencv-python==4.8.1.78

# MQTT and Database
paho-mqtt==2.1.0
mysql-connector-python==8.0.33

# Additional dependencies (if not already in base image)
# These are typically already included in ultralytics:jetpack5
# pillow>=8.4.0
# matplotlib>=3.5.0
# pandas>=1.5.0
# pyyaml>=6.0
# tqdm>=4.64.0
# requests>=2.28.0
# scipy>=1.9.0
# psutil>=5.9.0

# Jetson-specific optimizations
# Note: PyTorch with CUDA support is already included in ultralytics:jetpack5
# The base image includes:
# - torch (with CUDA support)
# - torchvision
# - ultralytics
# - numpy
# - opencv-python-headless (we replace with opencv-python)
# - matplotlib, pandas, pyyaml, tqdm, requests, scipy, psutil
